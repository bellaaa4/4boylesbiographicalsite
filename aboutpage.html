    <h1>How I got into design</h1>
    <p>
      In 7th and 8th grade, I took a class with the “tech” teacher that included coding and film.
      This got me interested in taking computer-related classes since I found working with computers
      something I really enjoyed. I was offered to take this class since it combined things I was
      passionate about: art and computer design. When I was presented with this opportunity,
      of course I had to take it.

    <h1>My Interests / Hobbies</h1>
    <p>
      I'm super passionate about design and all sorts of things including art. I've also played a
      multitude of sports throughout my high school years including soccer and basketball! I'm really
      passionate about all sorts of entertainment media — I'm a huge movie fanatic. My favorites include
      "All the Bright Places" (a real tear jerker) and "Waves". Music is a huge thing for me too;
      I can't ever work without some sort of music — helps me focus for sure!

    <h1>My Future</h1>
    <p>
      As a junior in high school, I recognize I don't have that much longer to figure out what I want
      to do in my life. I'm really passionate about art, law, and criminal justice. I would love to
      continue my pathway in graphic design and web design and learn even more about the subject! I would
      also love to design a clothing brand in the future (I've already got some examples you'll be able
      to see on the gallery page).

	<p class="about-page-content">On this page, I added a header, navigation bar, and a hero to make this much more professional. I made the hero sections with divs to give basic information about myself to th viewer. I then added an embedded CSS file to give my page all of it's styling from how things are positioned to more intricate things such as the color of the text and borders. I applied this CSS to all of the pages on this website to ensure I could easily adjust any style across all my pages easily. Within my CSS I added a column property giving the three options at the bottom of the page detailing more about myself and my business.</p>
